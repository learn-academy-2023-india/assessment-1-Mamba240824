// ASSESSMENT 1: Coding Conceptual Questions

// Examine the following examples.

// First, predict the outcome based on your understanding of the code.
// Then, uncomment the console.log() and verify the output. Briefly explain why your initial answer was correct or incorrect.
// There is no need to change any of the code.

// --------------------INSTRUCTOR EXAMPLE: What will this log?
const colors = ["tangerine", "magenta", "lilac", "daffodil"]
 //console.log(colors.push("indigo"))

// a) Your answer:its gonna say how many data types there now is in the array.
// b) Verify and explain: The output was "5" which accurately shows that there is now 5 strings in the array. 

// --------------------1) What will this log?

const cohort = "LEARN 2023"
// console.log(cohort.length)

// a) Your answer: the code is going to ouput the numbers of charactors and spaces inside the string. 
// b) Verify and explain: the output was 10 which is the length if you count "learn" the space " " and "2023" which is 10 total.

// --------------------2) What will this log?

const greeting = "Hello World!"
//console.log(greeting[4])

// a) Your answer: It should output an "o" which is the charactor that is in the 4th index since the count starts at zero. 
// b) Verify and explain:the output was o which means my assumption was in line. 

// --------------------3) What will this log?

const languages = ["JavaScript", "Ruby", "Python", "C++"]
const index = 1
 //console.log(languages[index])

// a) Your answer: the index is counting out the datatypes in the array. so the output should be "ruby" since index counts always start at 0.
// b) Verify and explain:The output was Ruby and the code performed as expexted. 

// --------------------4) What will this log?

const weekendDays = ["saturday", "sunday"]
 //console.log(weekendDays.toUpperCase())

// a) Your answer:The code will change the values in the array into capital letters. 
// b) Verify and explain:the code outputed a Type error. It did not run. 

// --------------------5) What will this log?

const dataTypes = ["number", "string", "Boolean", "undefined"]
console.log(typeof dataTypes.length)

// a) Your answer:The output will be a 4 since that is the number of data types in the array.
// b) Verify and explain:The output was "number" and im honestly confused as to why that is and will ask for clarity.
